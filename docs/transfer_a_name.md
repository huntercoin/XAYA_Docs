# Transfer a Name

You can transfer names between your game and vault wallet, or you can transfer a 
name to another person using one of their CHI addresses.

To transfer a name:

1. Click [My Names](my_names.md) in the left-side navigation.

2. Find the name that you wish to transfer.

3. On the right-hand side on the same line as the name you wish to transfer, 
click TRANSFER.

5. Click OK to transfer the name.

6. A dialog with the transaction ID appears. Click OK to close it.

Your name will remain in your wallet while the transfer is being confirmed. Once 
it is confirmed, it will disappear.

If you transferred the name to your other wallet, you can check [My 
Names](my_names.md) or [Transactions](transactions.md) in that wallet.
