# Transactions

The Transactions screen has a complete record of your transaction history.

The relevant fields are:

• Address: The address in your wallet involved in the transaction.

• Name/Label: If the transaction was for a name, then relevant name information 
is displayed here. Often these are game moves.

• Category: This tells you whether you sent or received CHI, as well as whether 
the coins are generated (mined).

• Amount: This is the amount of CHI. Sent CHI are negative, and received CHI are 
positive.

• Date: This is the date and time of the transaction in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 
format.

• Confirmations: This is the number of confirmations for the transaction. 
Loosely speaking, this is how many blocks have been mined since then.
