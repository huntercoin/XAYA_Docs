Creating names is one of the most important aspects of the wallet. Here you can 
create names for accounts that you use for different games.

## Choosing an Account Name

To create a name for use as an account for games:

1. Choose the "p/" namespace from the Select preset namespace drop-down menu. 
This is for reserving account names.

3. Leave the Name Value input empty.

4. Click SUBMIT NAME.

You can check your acount name on the [My Names screen](my_names.md).

## Choosing a Game Name

This is not the actual name of your game. XAYA uses "name" as jargon. Here, a 
"game name" is more traditionally best described as a "game ID".

To create a name for use as game name:

1. Choose the "g/" namespace from the Select preset namespace drop-down menu. 
This is for reserving game names.

You can check your game name on the [My Names screen](my_names.md).
