# My Names

The My Names screen lists all of the names that you've reserved for yourself. 
The following example has 1 name, but you could have many more.

![my-names-screen-1-name](img/my-names-screen-1-name.zoom53.png)

There are 4 columns:

• XAYA Name: This is the proper name that you've reserved.

• Name Value (optional): This is simply the JSON expression of your name.

• Address: This is the CHI address for your name.

• Update/Transfer: This allows you to change the properties of your name or to 
transfer your name (account) to someone else.

Unless you fully understand what an update is, you should NOT update your name. 
Updating names is an advanced feature meant for experts.

Transferring a Name

You can transfer a name to someone else by sending the name to a valid CHI 
address.

1. Click TRANSFER for the name you wish to transfer.

2. Paste in the CHI address that you want to transfer the name to.

The name is transferred to the address. You can check the transaction on the 
[Transactions screen](transactions.md).
