# Settings

The Settings screen lets you change connection settings, back up your wallets, 
and switch to testnet.

Advanced users can change connection settings.

Unless you fully understand the connection settings, you should leave them as 
is.

Advanced users and miners can make the changes they need, then click the SUBMIT 
SETTINGS button to save their new connection settings.

The DataDir Override allows you to change the directory where the XAYA 
blockchain, wallets, and other data is stored. The default directory is:

%APPDATA%\\Xaya\\

e.g. C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Xaya

On Linux the datadir is here:

~/.xaya/

Or here:

~/home/<user>/xaya/

On OS X (Mac) the datadir is here:

~/Library/Application Support/Xaya/

People with limited space on their system drive may wish to change the datadir 
folder location.

6. Browse to your backup in your file explorer and perform any additional backup 
plans you have, e.g. save it to a USB stick or external drive.

See [Back Up Wallets](back_up_wallets.md) for additional information or 
[Manually Backing Up Wallets](back_up_wallets.htm#manuallybackingupwallets) for 
how to do it manually.

## Testnet

To switch to testnet, check the Testnet checkbox then click the SUBMIT SETTINGS 
button and restart the XAYA Electron wallet.

Testnet is used for testing. Most people have no need for testnet.

However, if you wish, you can use testnet to try out different features and 
become familiar with them before you "go live" and try them on mainnet.
